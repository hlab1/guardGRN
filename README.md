#Guard cell GRN inference with MINI-EX
Date: 6-30-2025
Part of "Uncovering the core genetic programs governing guard cell biology - Nguyen et al., 2025 (unpublished as of 6-30-2025)

#Method
MINI-EX (https://github.com/VIB-PSB/MINI-EX/tree/main, Ferrari et al., 2022) was used to generate GRNs based on TF annotations
without using the motif filtering information to avoid losing guard cell TFs that could lack annotation

GO enrichment analysis for guard cell regulons was performed to group similar modules into module groups based on shared enrichment terms
Enrichment was performed and visualized on individual modules to validate module grouping and provide module-level GO information 

Whole network visualization of module and module grouping assignments was performed in Cytoscape, with nn=1 of key guard cell genes observed
#in the whole network used to generate and visualize a subnetwork

#Files:
atha_guardGRN <- annotated cytoscape network file
ATHA_INPUTS <- inputs to MINI-EX, generated from annotated Arabidopsis .Rds 
	- ATHA_allMarkers.tsv - marker genes
	- ATHA_cells2clusters.tsv - cell/cluster identities
	- ATHA_identities.tsv - seurat cluster/cell type identities 
	- ATHA_matrix.tsv - expression matrix
ATHA_network_guard.tsv - filtered guard cell network information from ATHA_network.tsv
ATHA_network.tsv - full Arabidopsis GRN generated from make_networkfile.sh
ATHA_NOMOTIF_OUTPUTS - outputs from MINI-EX and log file including config settings
	- ATHA_log - MINI-EX parameters and run info
	- figures - figures generated by the MINI-EX pipeline
	- grnboost2 - network generated by grnboost2
	- regulons - module/regulons info files generated by MINI-EX
